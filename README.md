# WeeChat and BitlBee in Docker

This repo contains instructions on how to build a docker image that will run
[BitlBee](http://www.bitlbee.org/) and [WeeChat](http://www.weechat.org/).

## Docker registry

This image is available on the [Docker registry](https://index.docker.io/) as
[nate/weechat-bitlbee](https://index.docker.io/u/nate/weechat-bitlbee/):

```
$ docker pull nate/weechat-bitlbee
```

## Building

```
$ git clone https://github.com/justone/docker-weechat-bitlbee
$ docker build --rm -t weebit .
```

## Running

This will run with a temporary home directory, so all BitlBee and WeeChat
configuration and logs will be lost when you exit WeeChat:

```
$ docker run --rm -i -t weebit
```

You can specify a host volume and that will be used for BitlBee users as well
as the home directory for WeeChat.  This means configuration and logs will go
into that directory and will persist across container runs:

```
$ docker run --rm -i -t -v /host/path:/weechat weebit
```

Finally, if you specify a USER environment variable, the user inside the
container will use that name instead of `weechat`:

```
$ docker run --rm -i -t -v /host/path:/weechat -e USER=bob weebit
```
